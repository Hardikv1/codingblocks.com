      "ans": "This is not CORE java or Advanced Java. This is a course which teaches you problem solving, data structures and Object Oriented Programming. Though, most of what CORE java means is being covered. The aim of the course is to help you with a smarter beginning. For being able to make web and mobile apps you need to learn frameworks. Android is one such framework for mobile apps. Please check out our Pandora and Elixir course for more details on these lines."
