If you have had a mathematical background at school and covered engineering mathematics (such as probability, statistics, linear algebra etc/), you're good to go! Maybe you could just brush up the topics."

      "ques": "I know competitive programming. should I do this course?",
      "ans": "Machine Learning requires extensive knowledge of mathematics, which you also gain while handling problems in competitive programming. This course shall equip with the right tools to handle huge amounts of data and derive meaningful conclusions from data crunching. Handling real-world problems is exactly what machine learning is all about, a skill very useful in development tasks. competitive programming equips you with critical thinking, but machine learning teaches you how to apply that skill and solve complex problems."

Python is a relatively easy language to learn, and you can pick up the basics very quickly. Therefore, you’ll have ample amount of time before the course to brush-up/learn the fundamentals."
